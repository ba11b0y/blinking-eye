## Blinking-Eye
### A simple CLI to visualise inbound connections to a Tor Bridge

#### Setup instructions:
 - Clone the repository
 - Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - Make sure you get a `cache.sqlite` file from your system running a Tor bridge with [nyx](https://nyx.torproject.org/) as a monitor. By default it is stored at `~/.nyx/logs`
 - Either place it in the root directory or provide a path.

#### Usage:

```
usage: blink.py [-h]
                [-p /home/invinciblycool/Documents/Github-projects/blinking-eye]
                [-pts 20]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p /path/to/cache.sqlite, --path /path/to/cache.sqlite
                        str: Path to the cache.sqlite file generated by nyx
  -pts 20, --points 20  int: Number of points to plot on the map

```

#### Disclaimer:
Connecting to the Tor Network with a VPN renders the project useless, although it is the best practice.
